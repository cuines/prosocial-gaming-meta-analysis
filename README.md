# Prosocial Gaming Meta-Analysis

A collaborative, open-science meta-analysis investigating the relationship between playing prosocial video games and the development of emotion regulation skills in adolescents.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to synthesize existing research on how prosocial video games influence emotion regulation in adolescents (ages 10-19). By adopting open-science practices, we aim to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and broad collaboration across the research community.

## Methodology

This meta-analysis will follow PRISMA guidelines and include:
- Systematic literature search across multiple databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, etc.)
- Pre-registered protocol
- Transparent data extraction and coding
- Robust statistical analysis (random-effects models, moderation analysis)
- Publication bias assessment

## Repository Structure

- `protocol/` – Search protocols, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction forms
- `data/` – Extracted data, coding sheets, and analysis scripts
- `analysis/` – R/Python scripts for meta-analytic computations
- `manuscript/` – Drafts, figures, and supplementary materials
